NAME
       programmers.party - collective of programmers

DESCRIPTION
       programmers.party  is a collective of programmers. This is a collective
       of software scientists who enjoy the art of software development. There
       is no lower or upper bound of knowledge required to participate, just a
       demonstrated ability to try and keep trying.

JOINING
       There is only one requirement to join the collective. You must  have  a
       willingness  to  try and to keep trying even after failing. If you feel
       that this describes you then you should reach out to an existing member
       of  the  collective and introduce yourself. In a way this is your first
       chance to demonstrate your ability to try when the solution is not  ob‚Äê
       vious. I believe in you
